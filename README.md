# BinInfo

This Android application uses the following technologies:

- **Kotlin** and Android Jetpack
- **Jetpack Compose** for UI
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Retrofit** with **OkHttp** for network calls
- **Room** for local database
- **Coroutines** for asynchronous tasks
- **Navigation Compose** and **ViewModel**
- **Gradle** Kotlin DSL

The project also attempts to implement **Clean Architecture**, although the structure is not completely refined yet.
